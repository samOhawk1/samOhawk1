### 🧠 Currently Contemplating the Mysteries Of:

* ⚛️ *Containerized Existentialism* (with a hint of Dockerfile divination)
* ☁️ *The AWS Elasticity Singularity* (and praying my free tier survives it)
* ✨ *Reactive Flux Capacitors* (powered by `useState`, `useEffect`, and occasional desperation)
* 🎼 *Orchestrating Serverless Symphonies* (before the Lambdas unionize)
* 🚧 *The Subtle Art of Not Breaking Production* (while chasing the thrill of `yarn add`)
* 💰 *Cloud Cost Optimization* (a.k.a. budgeting with tears)

---

### 🌟 Future Ambitions:

> If "serverless spaghetti" ever becomes an architectural best practice, I'll finally understand Terraform.  
> Until then, expect elegant hacks, caffeine-fueled fixes, and Stack Overflow bookmarks.
